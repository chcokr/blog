# Hubris

Lately I've been thinking a lot about hubris and humbleness.
It is quite the theme that defines the past two years after I returned to
college.

I've tried a few things since I came back to college.
I gave mathematics a serious chance.
I tried taking challenging graduate courses, and realized I did not want to
pursue math as a career.
If I kept trying, I'm sure I would've done not so bad.
I'm not necessarily questioning my mathematical capacity from back then.
If I did badly during those days, it was probably 70% because I spent too little
time thinking on coursework and 30% because of the limits of my intelligence.
What did convince me to switch away from mathematics was that it would probably
take me too much longer than I wanted before I prove myself valuable to the
community - be it the mathematics community or those in need of math.
It was becoming clear that what I truly pursued at heart was recognition.

Around this time I had the honor of interning at Microsoft.
This was definitely good in terms of recognition - I was proud (and still am)
that I got a prestigious internship after sophomore year.
But looking back, I knew too little to qualify as a good engineer, from my
perspectives of today.
I did not know how to make good use of version control.
I did not have a good sense of *building* a project.
My vision of testing a product was too myopic.
My coding skills were good, but I did not pay attention to the intricate layers
of abstraction that make coding beautiful and maintainable.
I mean, to be fair, I was only a sophomore intern, so it was in my opinion
understandable I didn't know all these things as much as I do now (and I still
don't).
But the problem from back then was that I was arrogant.
I had such a narrow-sighted understanding of software that I thought some
elegant lines of code were all I needed to qualify as a good engineer.
I couldn't have been more wrong, but back then, I really thought I was some hot
shit.
I am ashamed of my attitude from those days.

What I did do well during my internship days, though, was that I started reading
up a large volume of online resources about software and, more specifically,
the JavaScript ecosystem.
The influx of fresh knowledge outside work or school was mind-blowing.
I started caring about how to leverage version control, and how to architecture
code in a future-proof manner.
I was slowly coming to a more humble state, where I was mesmerized at the
complexity of industry-level engineering.
A lot of it had to do with just realizing the scale of real engineering.
I was being gradually exposed to it, thanks to all those nice people who write
up engineering blogs and do open-source work.

Then I took a semester off to dive into launching an Android app into
production.
**Production**.
Only then I was able to realize how much weight this workd carries (or I still
don't).
Launching anything into production is a sacred processs to ensure your product
won't die away being bullied out there in the windy world.
What if this server instance goes down.
What if this untested user scenario comes into action.
What if some crazy security hack takes place.
Through these thoughts I was able to think in probabilistic terms.
*Doing this will increase the probability of my product not breaking down.*
*Doing that will introduce too much new risk into my product's stability.*
You know, these are thoughts that any decent engineer has to go through.
In my case, though, it was a particularly bitter experience because the
learnings opened my eyes to my prior arrogance.

These times was great, but I don't think it made me humble enough.
As I read through blog posts that I wrote during those startup days, I still
find a lot of the writing to be quite arrogant (which is why, when I transfer
them over from Medium to GitHub, I redact a lot of sentences).
There were clear signs all across the posts that I wanted to *show off* what
little knowledge I had, instead of simply delivering the knowledge.
I am not very proud of the pieces produced during those days.
I'd prefer my writing be bland-tasted.
I'm trying to write in that style - I hope it conveys.

Then I came back to college (a second return), and things were fine.
But there was an important occasion around July - August of 2015.
On top of my full-time job, my summer coursework, my research, and my personal
projects, I suddenly burned out.
One morning I woke up crying, asking myself why I wasn't happy.
A big epiphany took place.
Maybe I don't love coding *that much*.
Prior to that day I didn't perceive coding as work.
I enjoyed it so much (still do), but I was not getting the right signs telling
me when I should stop.
It was like drinking alcohol without getting the stop signs.
You keep drinking because it's fun, and then end up in a bad state.
This drinking analogy was exactly how I was with coding.
I was always under the constant stress that I had to produce code, think code,
at all times.
I was thinking arrogantly I could handle all the stress and the work by myself.
Looking back, I should've been more humble about my limits and consulted someone
while going through such peaks of workload.
Maybe I'll do that in the future.

Thankfully, around late August, a friend of mine convinced me to go out to the
oceanside to refresh my mind.
I did, and it worked very well.
One of those nights, I looked up at the skies from the marina.
I had never seen so many stars.
There was also a thunderstorm going on far away.
So the skies were filled with stars upon my eyes but there were lots of
lightnings at the edges of the view.
I just want to be one of those thousands of little dots who sit at their places.
