This weekend would have been a huge one, if I actually cared about my molds.
University commencement and my sister's wedding took place on this same weekend.
I went to neither.
It was just another Friday.

College and family were two molds that I had so wished to grow out of.
College, to me, was mostly a tasteless experience, a rite of passage imposed on
me by social and parental expectations.
In freshman year I enjoyed my math major, cherished friendships, and experienced
a great romantic relationship.
Three years later, when I came back from army, everything was different -
because I was different.
I had switched away from idealism into relentless pragmatism, was bitter from
unattained romance, and now only cared about having a future that I thought
others would envy.
Such a personality shift naturally led to a distate toward the seemingly bubbly
(IMO) nature of school.
I only thought about growing out of this mold, like a caterpillar awaiting
metamorphosis.

My family has been apart for almost all of my lifetime.
Not in a bad way.
When I was little, my dad worked extreme hours, and my sister was submerged in
academic work, so I lacked interaction with them.
Then my dad's job sent the family to France, and my family decided to not take
my sister with the three of us because of academic reasons.
I think I got to see her for only two months total, out of the three years in
Paris.
Then I went to boarding school for high school.
Then I came to the US for college, then army, then back to college.
All these years, I got to see family only little.
While a _whole_ family thus remained a distant concept over the years, this
notion of uncertainty started haunting my mom in bad ways - she was always
afraid what would become of me.
Would I do well in school.
Would I get a job.
Would I survive in a foreign country.
So family (especially mom) always felt like a mold, so distant yet tightly
gripping my senses.

As of 2016 I have graduated from school without a problem, have found myself an
enjoyable job, and am doing well in California.
I have officially grown out of my molds.

I couldn't go to my sister's wedding, because of US visa complications.
It's fine - it's all just part of growing out of my mods.
Having heard the news that my sister's wedding went well, I now condescendingly
look over college campuses, filled with family, maybe extended family, who are
so proud of their sons and daughters for some reason.

A campus where I never belonged.
Family whom I never had in one place.
As I wistfully imagine my family smiling in photos with me at commencement, it
scares me that I'm not sure if I've grown out of my molds, or if I'm just
escaping from them.
