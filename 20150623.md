# "But it didn't work in my office!" - Is it really magic?

In the summer of 2015, I maintained a Wordpress blog titled "The IT Crowd" as
part of a college writing course.
This was the mission statement of my blog:

> Over the summer I will be sharing some stories from my internship at Duke
University's biology department.
You're probably thinking my job involves some sort of biology, but in fact I
know nothing about biology.
Try to guess why I'm there based on what I do: I answer a lot of emails, and
about half of them involve asking to turn the computer off and on.
That's right, I work for the department's IT support team.
We're a small team of 6 people overseeing hundreds of department members and the
computers they use, so sometimes the day could be quite busy.
While asking to reboot over and over again might sound quite boring, in fact the
job is a lot more than that.
Having specialized knowledge across a multitude of topics is one thing, but
explaining it to non-technical folks is another.
The most exciting part about tech support is that, despite the obviously
technical nature, there is always that one human factor by the end of any
support session.
On my blog, I want to explore these psychological intricacies behind customer
support: what makes our customers satisfied, and how we train ourselves to meet
such expectations.

The following was Post #2.

I often get to witness magical spells at my job.
This other day a customer walked in, and spent five minutes right away
explaining how a finance reporting software just wouldn't open up.
I said, "OK, let me try it here."
Boom, the software opened up.
"But it didn't work in my office!" said the customer, now happy but perplexed.
If this isn't magic, then what is?

No, of course this isn't magic.
Something must have changed between when the customer tried and when I did.
Abstractly speaking, when a computer is told to do something and is given an
exact same state, it can only do one same thing.
So a software opening up in one room and not in another is not magic – something
about the two rooms were making the state of the computer vary.
We headed off to her office together.

She was right – the software really wasn't loading up there.
I sat down and started asking questions.
"What could be different between the two rooms?
All we did was walk in and out."
I was honestly stuck.
She joked, "I don't know. Air?"
Heck, I doubt even air changed.
Taking a deep breath, I started typing in some commands, but I knew I wasn't
going anywhere.
I had turned the computer off and on (of course), I troubleshooted some common
misconfigurations, but I was still lost.
That's when she added to the joke, "- or whatever flows through air, like sound
or Wi-Fi or something."
It was still a joke, but I thought about if for a moment.
If there were anything to change between the other room and here…

Wi-Fi!
The room seemingly had a good Wi-Fi connection, but some internal settings of
the wireless connection could be stopping the software from loading.
The customer confirmed that the software needs Internet connection to an
internal server on the campus.
I started digging through the internal wireless configurations, and found out
that the computer was connecting to the Internet not via the campus network, but
some strange network I had never seen.
The Wi-Fi router near her office must have been configured incorrectly.
I changed the setting back to the campus one, and voila, the software finally
opened up in her office.

"Oh gosh, thanks so much!
That worked like magic," she told me.
No, thank you – you were the one who suggested Wi-Fi could be the cause of the
problem.
You see, even a seemingly non-technical customer has a lot to contribute to a
tricky technical problem. So it is my job to listen carefully, to ask
investigating questions, and to collect as much information from my customers.
If the problem is something immediately solvable, then it will start surfacing
up slowly once I communicate enough with the customer.
I find it analogous to hiking.
The map is there, the mountain is there – but the only way to make sense out of
these given things is to interact with the map and the paths to the extent where
I have enough knowledge to direct myself to top.
Then once I reach the peak, the view would be magical.

That's why I don't believe in magic.
I believe in customers and technology.
