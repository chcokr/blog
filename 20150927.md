# Academic Interests, Career Goals, Personal Interests

I wrote the following piece in June 2015 for a writing course in school.
I had been asked to write "an essay detailing your academic interests, career
goals and personal interests."
I think this piece provides a perspective on my past couple of years.

========

I believe my academic interests and career goals are best explained when
accompanied with a little explanation of my personal history.
I started college in the fall of 2010.
Back then I was an aspiring mathematics major, I enjoyed the theoretical nature
of math, and worked hard to earn a Freshman Julia Dale Prize from the
Mathematics Department by the end of the year.
Looking back, I consider myself of these days to be more of an idealistic type.

I conjecture that, if I did not have to take a leave of absence after my
freshman year to finish my two-year military service in South Korea, I would
have committed to finishing a degree in math.
During my service I worked in a military police department, where I got to
experience of all sorts of new situations and emotions involving human
interaction.
I underwent a dramatic opportunity to soak myself in down-to-earth reality, and
as such I started questioning the idealistic sides of myself.

When I came back to school in the fall of 2013, I tried hard at mathematics to
the extent of enrolling in multiple graduate-level courses, but I often found
myself frustrated and unable to consume the ingenious levels of abstraction
surrounding the theory.
Instead I had developed an attraction toward the discipline of software
engineering, which could immediately deliver a sense of value to the user.
Having attended coding contests (the so-called "hackathons") and winning prizes
at a couple, I was impressed with the immediacy of product development, and was
now ready to declare a transition to a major in computer science.
As such I dropped my major in mathematics; I still sometimes watch mathematical
ideas in awe, but I now have no plans to get involved into the theory in the
near future.

Even within the world of software engineering, I ventured through a lot of
areas.
I initially wanted to become a back-end developer.
Put simply, this term refers to an engineer who works on the infrastructure
behind a user-facing product.
For example, Google runs hundreds of thousands of computers in the background to
complete a search against the keywords the user has typed in.
Back-end developers work on making sure these servers are running correctly.
In contrast, front-end developers work on the things that the user immediately
sees.
Textboxes or buttons, for example, are visual objects that the user directly
interacts with.
Front-end engineering makes sure these visual interactions are aesthetic and
smoothly catered to the user.

While both are serious engineering disciplines, my experiences in the back-end
field were disappointing.
For instance, in the summer of 2014 I interned at a big software company where I
had a chance to work with both front-end and back-end projects, and I much
preferred the front-end work to the other.
I like to link this preference to my transition toward practicality and visual
gratification from theory and abstract profundity.
I took a one-semester leave of absence after my internship, in the fall of 2014,
to work on a personal software product idea, and my thoughts during this phase
reaffirmed my inclination.

I came back to school in the spring of 2015, and spent the semester focusing
mainly on personal software projects, much more so than on school work.
At this point my interest in academic pursuits has honestly been overshadowed by
my excitement into industry-level engineering, which is why I have decided to
finish college in three years.
As of now, summer 2015, I have completed two and a half semesters, and I will be
graduating by December.
I hope to work at a software company after graduation as front-end developer.

I would like to clarify that I do not look down upon either idealism or
pragmatism.
I still maintain a deep respect toward theoretical mathematicians; I wish I had
such tenacity.
On the other hand, I also do not think pragmatic disciplines like software
engineering completely lack a theoretical nature.
In fact, the more technology I learn, the more theory I notice behind the
patterns I repeatedly observe within engineering.
That is, my choice toward pragmatism from idealism was based upon how much
immediacy I wanted from my work, not upon how much I admired either.

As for personal interests outside my career aspirations, I would like to paste
in a paragraph I wrote for another writing course:

> YJ is a senior majoring in computer science at Duke University.

> The most recent one he finished was Parks and Recreation – that was a lot of

> He spends most of his free time hacking and writing code for that next big

> Originally from the suburbs of Seoul, South Korea, he’s enjoying the sunny
