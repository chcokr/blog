# "Can you come downstairs?" - Or should I go upstairs?

In the summer of 2015, I maintained a Wordpress blog titled "The IT Crowd" as
part of a college writing course.
This was the mission statement of my blog:

> Over the summer I will be sharing some stories from my internship at Duke
University's biology department.
You're probably thinking my job involves some sort of biology, but in fact I
know nothing about biology.
Try to guess why I'm there based on what I do: I answer a lot of emails, and
about half of them involve asking to turn the computer off and on.
That's right, I work for the department's IT support team.
We're a small team of 6 people overseeing hundreds of department members and the
computers they use, so sometimes the day could be quite busy.
While asking to reboot over and over again might sound quite boring, in fact the
job is a lot more than that.
Having specialized knowledge across a multitude of topics is one thing, but
explaining it to non-technical folks is another.
The most exciting part about tech support is that, despite the obviously
technical nature, there is always that one human factor by the end of any
support session.
On my blog, I want to explore these psychological intricacies behind customer
support: what makes our customers satisfied, and how we train ourselves to meet
such expectations.

The following was Post #7.

Though my job at Biology continues through the fall semester, I'd like to take
time to reflect on the customer support I've provided for the past ~2 years.

When I first started the job, I viewed it as an extension of my previous job at
a police department (before I came to college).
For a year and a half, work there always involved a sense of constant agility
involving potential life-and-death dangers and risks of violating human rights.
But at this job, I soon learned that customer support in IT is obviously much
more leisurely and I therefore had the luxury of experimenting a little with how
to approach my customers.

Initially I was pretty adamant about having the customers come to me.
The team policy was to encourage people to stop by our office unless the
opposite is absolutely necessary.
And to begin with, I did not want to spend my own time walking around the big
building trying to find my customers.
This deceiving sense of comfort, however, came at a cost.
Quite often customers would ignore our repeated emails, and their cooperation
seemed minimal.
Moreover, I felt a serious lack in what I consider the most important factor of
customer service: human interaction.
Since they are not at their usual environments, customers would not approach me
as friendly, and I kept sensing a glass barrier against the scope of my help.

So I changed my approach about half way through.
I now spent at least half of my day running around the department, providing
service on site and chatting with people.
The impact it had on the quality of my service was almost immediate.
The customers started giving me tours of their labs and sharing their personal
stories.
As such I was able to not only understand them better, but also see deeper into
their technical problems, because I now could engage them into opening up more
about their usage history and offering bits of information previously
undisclosed.
For example, I had a customer who routinely brought his work laptop home and ran
data analysis software remotely.
This opened the machine up to vulnerabilities that would not take place on
campus.
Before I had become closer with him, he wouldn't discuss the fact that he used
the analysis software remotely.
But now that I discovered about the remote usage, I could provide new insight
and eventually resolve the issue.

My advice for whoever joins us is to always take that extra step outside the
office and provide first-hand service.
Staying inside and having people come to you might feel comfortable.
But the true interaction you achieve after you really reach out and help
customers on site is more satisfying than anything.
