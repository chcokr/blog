# "Have you turned your computer off and on?" - Does it really work?

In the summer of 2015, I maintained a Wordpress blog titled "The IT Crowd" as
part of a college writing course.
This was the mission statement of my blog:

> Over the summer I will be sharing some stories from my internship at Duke
University's biology department.
You're probably thinking my job involves some sort of biology, but in fact I
know nothing about biology.
Try to guess why I'm there based on what I do: I answer a lot of emails, and
about half of them involve asking to turn the computer off and on.
That's right, I work for the department's IT support team.
We're a small team of 6 people overseeing hundreds of department members and the
computers they use, so sometimes the day could be quite busy.
While asking to reboot over and over again might sound quite boring, in fact the
job is a lot more than that.
Having specialized knowledge across a multitude of topics is one thing, but
explaining it to non-technical folks is another.
The most exciting part about tech support is that, despite the obviously
technical nature, there is always that one human factor by the end of any
support session.
On my blog, I want to explore these psychological intricacies behind customer
support: what makes our customers satisfied, and how we train ourselves to meet
such expectations.

The following was Post #1.

--------

I named my blog after a popular British TV show.
In the comedy, whenever the IT customer representatives receive a phone call,
they start by asking "Thanks for calling IT – have you turned your computer off
and on?"
Indeed, rebooting a software or a hardware is, I'd assume, any IT
representative's favorite first-aid to a malfunction
But is it actually effective?
Aren't these IT folks just too lazy to try other things?

Based on my experience as a computer programmer for years and as a current IT
representative, I can tell you with confidence that rebooting is by far the
single most effective solution to almost any issue.
This other day, I had to respond to a printer that would not read in from the
card swiper.
I tried all sorts of things, from tampering with the settings in the internal
software to replacing the swiper – to no avail.
When I came back to the office all frustrated, my coworker suggested a brilliant
solution: "Did you restart it?"
No, for some silly reason I had forgotten that was a thing.
I went back upstairs and restarted it.
Just like magic, everything worked.

But is it really magic?
What is exactly going on when a software or a hardware is re-launched?
It is difficult for me to provide an explanation for every possible scenario in
the technical world, but my programming experience gives me a hint as to how
this magic occurs.
When a software/hardware is started, it is initialized to a certain initial
state.
For example, a printer could be in the state of "let's move the cartridges
around, let's get the rollers rolling, etc."
Then, every time something happens to the printer, the state of the machine
changes.
Say someone walked by and swiped an ID card.
The machine now is in the state of "let's reveal this person's name" and much
more.

As time goes by, these state changes keep accruing, and there are so many
variables defining a printer's state, to the extent that the engineers who made
the printer couldn't account for all possible scenarios.
So, after someone swipes an ID card for, say, five times in a row, the printer
somehow falls in a state that no engineer had ever foreseen.
That's when the printer crashes.
This is the primary reason for a vast number of software/hardware bugs across
the world – because the mere mortal humans who created the equipment couldn't
predict every possible scenario.

So how does this insight relate to the magical power of rebooting?
Think about what state a machine would go back to when it is rebooted – the
initial state!
Remember "let's move the cartridges around, let's get the rollers rolling"?
We know this state is guaranteed to work, because engineers must have worked
very hard to ensure this very first state upon launch works through.
Thus a rebooted machine, at its well-tested initial state, works just fine.

But then, the printer could always go back to that weird state, if it did so at
least once already, right?
Indeed, any issue cured by a reboot is not actually completely fixed.
A reboot is only a temporary workaround.
So why don't I spend a little more time investigating how to never reach that
eird state ever again?
Maybe, if I were lucky, I could figure out the root cause of the problem and
come up with a permanent fix.

The reason I wouldn't bother investing extra time is a simple economic
cost-benefit analysis: because the cost of my predicted labor for this fix is
higher than the benefit the team gets out of the permanent resolution.
I could easily foresee dozens of hours being spent on trying to reproduce and
address the issue – likely to no avail.
As opposed to going down that tedious path, if I just walk away, wait a few days
till the same issue somehow arises again and tell someone around the printer to
just restart the machine, I only spend a minute or two addressing the issue and
work on other things such as watching The IT Crowd over my lunch time.

I believe that behind any technical situation, there's always a human factor.
Underneath the seemingly obvious and boring task of restarting a printer, I am
pleased to discover an economic and psychological contention between challenging
and withdrawing.
So, no, I am not just being lazy – turning your computer off and on is indeed
the most effective solution given the circumstances.
