# Blessings

Today is one of those days that make me realize I'm surrounded with blessings.

This afternoon I was sitting at a cafe to write some code.
I got to chat with the person sitting by me, who asked me what I was doing.
I explained the sort of open-source work I was doing, and how it would benefit
developer productivity.
This naturally led me to thinking what an amazing accomplishment and culture the
software community across the world has put together.
These folks, including myself, are spending hours out of their own unpaid
(mostly) time to share their workflows and thoughts.
While this might sometimes mean less sleep, in my opinion the end result is that
the engineering community as a whole constantly thinks in a forward-moving
direction.
It is just a blessing to watch these like-minded people discuss and share best
practices on GitHub and Twitter.

It was the other person's turn to talk.
It turns out the person began writing meditation stories for kids this spring,
after two major career switches.
For example, busy parents often won't have the time to read stories to their
kids.
This business offers an affordable monthly subscription that brings the kids a
new story every other week.

The interesting part here, according to this person, is that what this business
is trying to achieve would not have been possible just years ago.
The person had a background in meditation and education, so one likely career
scenario would have been to start a local meditation shop.
But using technologies like Wordpress and Stripe (*IMO* Stripe is amazing), this
far more broad-reaching idea of delivering stories every other week shaped up.
Listening to the anecdote of a four-year old excited to hear the biweekly voice,
I realized what a blessing it is to watch technology make an impact in a kid's,
or really, anyone's life.

As I'm writing this, my school is running a hackathon focusing on social impact.
All these students from all over the country are getting together to burn
late-night hours (and food) to develop new software/hardware to reach out to
those in need.

Then I think about things outside the tech world.
What would this world be without the work of service members and first
responders who make sure I am safe.
I can never forget the eye-opening nights at the police station I used to work
at.
I can never imagine the sacrifice of those who risk their lives in battlefields.

I think about my family who have given me the opportunity to achieve what I am
today.
I think about my parents who made it through the hardest times and made this
family a success.
I think about my sister who teaches in elementary and makes a change in
countless young souls.

Lately I ponder a bit about the meaning of friendship.
Yes, there are moments when I have doubts about true friendship.
But as I travel, and as I notice folks from back in the day are simply willing
to share their moments and thoughts, I am humbled by the genuine loveliness of
those I have run into.

I am surrounded with blessings.

Last but not least, I love and miss my dog!
