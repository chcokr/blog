# Take Me to React.js Conf

The first [React.js Conf](http://conf.reactjs.com) is upon us!
For those who are going, the next two days will be fun, I imagine.
I really wanted to go, but I couldn’t get the tickets in time.
So I applied to their [diversity conference
scholarship](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/12/19/react-js-conf-diversity-scholarship.html)
earlier this month.
I didn’t make it to be one of the lucky ten, but I liked my essay, so I’d like
to share it with everyone.
I think it candidly speaks where I stand as a programmer right now.

I’m coming to the [Rejects Happy
Hour](http://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-San-Francisco/events/219642482/), though!

=======

I remember that night back in January 2004 when my first lines of JavaScript
triggered an alert modal upon a button click.
Despite my programming-unfriendly mom yelling “stop wasting time on the
Internet,” the sense of immediacy at which code enabled human interaction was
purely thrilling.
But the cheap thrills occupied me for too long; I must admit, for the next ten
years I had been coding with no sufficient philosophy against software
complexity.
Blind-sighted by the urge to add that next DOM element as quickly as possible, I
would produce GUIs plastered with untraceable side-effects and string-generated
jQuery elements all over the page, without proper knowledge of architecture.

My discovery of JavaScript data-binding frameworks in early 2014 brought forth
epiphanies that had aged 10 years in the making; I could sense a raison-d’être
of cautiously managing software side-effects.
Among them, React.js and the Flux architecture caught particular attention with
the themes of unidirectionality and DOM diffing: they were concepts with firm
philosophy.
And this unique philosophy would transcend from an idealistic realm to a
pragmatic one thanks to Facebook Engineering’s excellent tools such as React-JSX
and the Flow type checker.
To me, the React.js Conference feels like a symbol of this spirit of tight
integration between academic and industrial concerns.
James Long would like to showcase his recent adventures with CSP and perhaps
transducers, concepts with academia background, followed by Michael Jackson
demonstrating the powerful react-router tool and perhaps dancing to Billie Jean.
It is exciting to picture myself at such a spectrum across pragmatism and
idealism, a diversity aligning precisely with my epiphanies of 2014.

Then there’s the people.
David Nolen’s blog posts have been a constant source of inspiration.
Advocating decades-old concepts such as immutability, he has impressively put
together ideas like ClojureScript and Om, and has proactively spread his work
through online channels.
What about Jafar Husain, the Netflix guru who introduced me to essential
frameworks including the Reactive Extensions.
Meeting these people, to me, is a dream-come-true, and exploring how they manage
to inject such potentially pedantic concepts into the industry is something to
look forward to.
Now I turn my attention away from the podium and realize I’m surrounded by the
audience many of who have made personal expenses to be in this same boat.
Listening to their passionate stories about software, I will be reminded of what
a great community I can stay involved with.

Of course, I don’t want to stop at soaking in others’ thoughts.
I want to be a part.
As an aspiring engineer, I feel responsible for consistently evaluating opinions
and making new suggestions, and nothing about this conference changes that
sentiment.
For instance, I’d love to hear people’s thoughts on the keynote speaker
Christopher Chedeau’s recent thought-provoking presentation "React: CSS in JS."
In this very presentation, he convinces the audience to "keep an open mind" and
"forget everything you know about web development" for a moment.
With a keynote speaker who isn’t afraid of challenging orthodox convention, the
React.js Conference could only be imagined as the right place to discuss the
future of software engineering.

When something’s been done wrong for ten years, there are two paths forward:
stay blind or set it straight.
I wonder what a feeling it would be to listen and talk in the same space with
the visionaries who pulled me out of those pitfalls of software without
philosophy.
And I shall pay it forward; with the experiences from the conference, I will
write better code, deliver better products, share my knowledge as does Facebook
Engineering, and perhaps get to dance to Billie Jean at awesome conferences like
the React.js Conference.
The conference will not only help leave my ten years behind, but will also bring
my next ten years forward.
