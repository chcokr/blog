# 2016

Over the past few days I've concluded that I'm at a very lucky place where my
life this year can be summed up to just four areas:

- Health
- Finance
- Dog
- Career

I believe this is a very privileged situation, so I wanted to make a daily
checklist that will help me maintain a balance across the above areas.
The checklist also offers a reflection upon the past year.

## Daily checklist

(not in any order)

Did I wake up reasonably early?

Did I make my bed?

Did I stick to a strict three-meal diet?

Did I not eat after 9pm?

Did I walk/run at least an hour?

Did I stick to the daily spending budget?

Did I spend an hour (on weekdays) or two (on weekends) for my puppy, addressing
a combination of the following areas:
- Under-eating
- Separation anxiety: in the room and in the crate
- Socialization with dogs
- Socialization with people
- Being too territorial
- Exercise
- Fetch

Did I work hard at my job, at the company's best interest?

Did I maintain a strict balance between work and personal hack ideas during work
hours?

Did I limit my software-related activity to at most 12 hours (unless work
required more)?

Did I spend an hour reviewing some sort of technical literature, where I didn't
skim the material and did not let go of it until I thoroughly understood it?
It's fine if it takes several days to understand just one piece of writing.

## Attitude

I know there will be a lot of days where not all of the checklist is kept.
Even in such a case, the checklist will provide an opportunity to do better the
next day.
