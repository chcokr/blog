# "Why is it taking so long?" - Can we do better?

In the summer of 2015, I maintained a Wordpress blog titled "The IT Crowd" as
part of a college writing course.
This was the mission statement of my blog:

> Over the summer I will be sharing some stories from my internship at Duke
University's biology department.
You're probably thinking my job involves some sort of biology, but in fact I
know nothing about biology.
Try to guess why I'm there based on what I do: I answer a lot of emails, and
about half of them involve asking to turn the computer off and on.
That's right, I work for the department's IT support team.
We're a small team of 6 people overseeing hundreds of department members and the
computers they use, so sometimes the day could be quite busy.
While asking to reboot over and over again might sound quite boring, in fact the
job is a lot more than that.
Having specialized knowledge across a multitude of topics is one thing, but
explaining it to non-technical folks is another.
The most exciting part about tech support is that, despite the obviously
technical nature, there is always that one human factor by the end of any
support session.
On my blog, I want to explore these psychological intricacies behind customer
support: what makes our customers satisfied, and how we train ourselves to meet
such expectations.

The following was Post #4.

--------

Customer support is filled with bottlenecks everywhere, especially when I have
to deal with teams that don't belong in the same hierarchy as my team's.
My team belongs in a big branch of tech services at Duke called Trinity
Technology Services, and for example, the team overseeing the printers in our
department (called the ePrint team) belongs in a completely separate branch
named Office of Information Technology.
In such a setup, it is hard to enforce or be enforced priorities, and
communication thus usually involves more overheads.
If not cautiously addressed, these bottlenecks make my team look like we're not
doing our best.
This Monday was a prime example of such overheads.

## The Fiasco

"The Fourth of July week is usually dead quiet," said my boss last week.
So as I walk in to work on Monday morning, I expect a silent day of not being
dispatched here and there.
Soon I receive an email from the boss: "Because of new updates pushed last
night, everyone in the department must reinstall the printer client on his/her
computer."

So I walk around installing the new client on dozens of computers.
At one point an unexpected customer comes by and requests help while I'm in the
middle of working on another machine.
She wants to install the new printer client on her Mac.
OK, all I have to do is to download and install the new client, like I have been
all morning!
But soon I realize I have been working only with Windows machines all morning,
and that the printing team's shiny new webpage does not actually list a Mac
client for some reason.

Now, since the ePrint team is outside our department, I need to put in a help
ticket to them and wait for however long until they respond, in order to get
something fixed.
In this case of the Mac client's strange whereabouts, it happens to take them
about an hour to send me the file.

I happily return to the customer who is about to leave for a meeting.
I tell her I'll have the installer running while she's away, which I shouldn't
have, because I needed her password to get admin access into the system.
I leave a note by her laptop, asking her to finish the installation.

When I come back in 30 minutes, she tells me the installation has finished and
I'm so ready to hear things print just fine.
Instead, she adds that the printer down the hall doesn't recognize her ID card
and fails to load up her printing queue. Now this is a whole new issue - I need
to make sure if the issue is specific to her account or to the printer.

Accordingly, I convince her to take a walk with me to another printer three
floors down, where we discover she's able to access her queue and print hard
copies of her beloved test.txt page.
Now I have evidence that the updates from last night caused the other printer to
malfunction - I decide to elevate the issue to my boss.

Ah, my boss happens to be working from home today, which means I have to
instant-message her.
My team uses a Facebook-like IM tool as our primary means of communication while
at work.
When people respond right away, IM is great, but when not, it feels like a
draggingly inefficient tool.
I know my boss dislikes phone calls to her office, so I didn't feel like a call
was an option in this case.
After 20 minutes, she answers my instant message and asks me to go around the
entire building and collect information on which printers are malfunctioning.
So my colleague and I walk around the big five-floor building and come across
four more printers acting up.

And of course, all my boss can do at this point is to report the printers to the
other team.
Three days later, as I write this, these printers are still malfunctioning and
communication with the other team seems really slow.
By now I can sense people's frustration as I walk down the hallway.
An admin staff passes by and complains, "Why is it taking so long to fix the
printers?"

## Post Mortem

So how can we do better as a team to handle unexpected overheads like this
Monday?
Of course, ideally the printing team would have informed us weeks in advance, so
my boss wouldn't happen to work from home and we would have sent out a warning
email much sooner.
But as IT professionals we must be ready to deal with uncertainty.
Let me identify the bottlenecks I came across on Monday and suggest how we could
have done better.

1. We need a better way to enforce software updates on the computers in our
purview.
Telling people to install a new client or walking around the building is very
time-consuming and error-prone.
In fact, it is one of my summer projects to come up with an automated software
monitoring/updating system, so I'm in charge here.

1. In an emergency like this, there should be a hotline established between us
and the other team.
Waiting for an hour until they send me a small file is a dreadful bottleneck.
I should have been able to directly get in phone contact with someone on the
printing team, without having to pass the word through my boss.

1. Whenever we work on a machine without its owner/user, we should create an
admin account on the operating system before the user leaves, so that we can
work on the machine without the user's presence.
In my story, I didn't have to wait until the customer came back to punch in her
password, if I had asked her to create me a new admin account I could work on.

1. We should have in advance had a monitoring system that would test each
printer in our purview by remotely printing test pages and reporting back the
statuses.
Walking around the entire building to check in person how each printer was doing
was a tiresome task.

1. We need to be more responsive on instant messaging.
I admit I'm quite often unresponsive on IM myself.
In this case, the IM bottleneck between me and my boss felt very frustrating, on
top of all the overhead I had to go through that day.

A professional in any field must be able to address and learn from unexpected
roadblocks.
This Monday was a busy and frustrating day, but I managed to learn a lot out of
it and see where the future workflows in my team could be headed.
